In order to perform an out-of-source build:
1. cd Build (or another directory)
2. cmake .. (.. points to the CMakeList.txt)
3. make

For new projects:
1. Copy CMakeLists.txt and adapt
2. Create a Build-directory (e.g. Build/)
and perform as described above.

For different build-configurations:
1. Directory Build-Release:
   Run cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. 
   instead of cmake .. in the build-directory
2. Directory Build-Debug:
   Run cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
   instead of cmake .. in the build-directory

   CMake automatically sets the appropriate compiler flags.

Hints:
- make VERBOSE=1 for more debug information of the build process
- Remove CMakeCache.txt if CMake does not recognize changes of CMakeLists.txt
